### About me :smile: <br/>
I am a student at CSUF, my favorite subjects would probably be computer science :computer: and math :pencil2:. <br/>
I'm currently interested in learning web development but would love to work with AI, data, and other fields of computer science. <br/>
My hobbies include watching/playing basketball :basketball: and playing games :video_game:. And eating food :spaghetti::curry::sushi:

Some goals that I have for this year are: <br/>
- Becoming a more efficient web programmer :shit:
- Building a mobile app :iphone: 
- learning about data science/AI :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- get good grades on my Assembly class :anguished:
